# Methodology
4 properties of Software:
- Conformity
- Invisibility
- Complexity
- Changeability

Fundamental Process:
- Specification: specify the requirement
- Development(Design and Implementation)
- Validation
- Evolution

Plan-driven: pre-plan all things and follow the plan
Agile: frequent release of the software. Test-First
-> Scrum: An Agile with a project management framework

Agile Principle:
- Customer involvement
- Incremental delivery
- People not process
- Embrace change
- Maintain simplicity

Requirement Engineering Process:
- Elicitation and Analysis: Discovering requirements from stakeholder
- Specification: Converting requirements into standard form
- Validation: Checking the requirements actually define the required system

Elicitation Techniques: 
- Interview
- Questionnaire
- Focus Group: group interview
- Observation

UML diagram：
- Activity
- Use case
- Sequence
- Class
- State Machine

System Architecture:
- Components
- How they use other's functionality and data
- manage between components

Architecture:
- Pipe and Filter
- Client and Server
- Layered
- Repository
- Model-View-Controller

Design OO System:
1. Understand the context and interaction with system
2. Design architecture
3. Identify principle
4. Develop model
5. Specify interfaces

OOD Principles:
- Single Responsibility
- Open/ Closed: Open for extension, Close for modification
- Liskov Substitution : child>= parent
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion

Design Patterns:
- Creational:
	- Singleton
	- Factory
- Structural
	- Adapter
	- Facade
- Behavioral
	- Observer
	- Strategy


Static Testing:
- WalkThrough
- Inspection

Dynamic Testing:
- White box testing:
	- Statement
	- Decision
	- Condition
	- Multiple-Condition
- Black box testing

Testing:
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing


Maintenance:
- Bug fixing
- Modifying software
- Implementing requirements
